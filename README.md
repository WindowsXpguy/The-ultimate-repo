# 🧰 The Conductor's Toolkit

This repo is a stash for real ones — proxies, HTML5 games, sketchy batch/HTML payloads, and guides that don’t come from your school’s IT department.  
Some of this was written by hand. Some of it was slapped together by AI. Doesn’t matter — it works.

## 🧩 What’s Inside

### 🌐 Proxies
- Web-based proxies (HTML/JS based)
- Localhost runners (Node/Go)
- Lightweight stealth loaders

### 🎮 Games
- HTML5 browser games
- Emulator loaders (maybe ROMs (if not for legal reasons on github) — figure that part out)

### 🧠 Tutorials
- VPN setup for locked-down systems
- Running payloads on Chromebooks and school junk
- How to use MEGA without leaving fingerprints
- Scripting basics (batch, HTML, etc.)

### 💣 Mega Links
> Real tools, archived stuff, and “questionable” content live off-site.  
Check `launchers/mega-links.txt` for links and access info.  
Some are encrypted. If you don’t know how to open it — you’re not ready.

## ⚠️ Heads Up

- Don’t act surprised if you get blocked or caught.
- This isn’t a hacking repo — it’s educational, experimental, and half-broken by design.
- AI wrote some scripts. We test and tweak them, but no promises.
- You break it? You fix it.

  halfly made by AI cause I'm a lazy prick :)
